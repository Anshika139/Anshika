Creating a landing Page
here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple landing page using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code
If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and open it.

Step 2: Create a New Folder
Create a new folder on your computer where you'll store your project files. You can name it anything you like, such as "landing-page-project".

Step 3: Create HTML File
Inside your project folder, create a new file named "index.html". This will be your HTML file where you'll write the structure of your landing page.

Step 4: Write HTML Structure
Open the "index.html" file in VS Code and write the basic structure of an HTML document:
This code creates a basic HTML structure with a header, section, and footer. It also links to an external CSS file named "styles.css".

Step 5: Create CSS File
Inside your project folder, create a new file named "styles.css". This will be your CSS file where you'll write the styles for your landing page.

Step 6: Write CSS Styles
Open the "styles.css" file in VS Code and add some basic styles to make your landing page look better:
Step 7: View Your Landing Page
Save both the "index.html" and "styles.css" files. Then, right-click on the "index.html" file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will open your landing page in a web browser, allowing you to see how it looks.

That's it! You've created a simple landing page using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. You can continue to add more content and styles to customize it further.
